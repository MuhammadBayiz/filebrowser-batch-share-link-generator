📖 DescriptionWhen managing large media servers (like Kurdish Cinema or streaming platforms), generating public share links for thousands of files manually via the FileBrowser WebUI is impossible.This Python script recursively scans a specific directory on your FileBrowser instance, creates a permanent public share for every video file found, and exports the results into a clean CSV file. This CSV can then be easily imported into a SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) or a spreadsheet.✨ FeaturesRecursive Scanning: Finds files in all subfolders.Smart Filtering: Only processes video formats (.mp4, .mkv, etc.) and ignores hidden system files/folders (like .Recycle_bin).Rate Limiting: Includes a small delay to prevent SQLite "Database is Locked" errors during high-volume requests.Direct URLs: Generates the raw /api/public/dl/ links ready for streaming or downloading.🚀 How to Use1. PrerequisitesEnsure you have Python 3 installed and the requests library:Bashpip install requests
2. Obtain your JWT (X-Auth Token)The script requires authentication to talk to the FileBrowser API.Log in to your FileBrowser WebUI via Chrome or Firefox.Press F12 to open Developer Tools and go to the Network tab.Refresh the page or click on any folder.Find a request named resources or items.Look at the Request Headers and copy the value of X-Auth. This is your JWT.3. Configure the ScriptOpen filebrowsergenerator.py and update the following variables:BASE_URL: Your FileBrowser URL (e.g., https://browser.yourdomain.com).TARGET_DIR: The folder path inside FileBrowser you want to scan.AUTH_TOKEN: The X-Auth token you copied in the previous step.4. Run the ScriptBashpython3 filebrowsergenerator.py
📊 OutputThe script will generate a file named file_links.csv in the same directory.File_PathDirect_URL/Movies/Action/Film.mp4https://yourdomain.com/api/public/dl/Td7rM144/Movies/Drama/Show.mkvhttps://yourdomain.com/api/public/dl/Ab12C345⚠️ Important NotesDatabase Safety: The time.sleep(0.1) is crucial. If you have a very powerful server with SSD storage, you can lower this, but for most SQLite setups, keeping it avoids Error 500 or Error 400.Token Expiry: JWT tokens usually expire. If the script starts returning 401 Unauthorized, simply grab a fresh X-Auth token from your browser.🤝 ContributingFeel free to fork this repository, report issues, or submit pull requests to improve the script!
